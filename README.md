BOM for mechanical parts is on the PDF.  Additionally, you will need 2x load cell amplifiers from Leo Bodnar:

If you are using my VPForce FFB mod, hook up the amplifiers to the 2 pot inputs on the USB board and set them as axes.  Otherwise, you will need some kind of joystick input arduino.

Enjoy!
